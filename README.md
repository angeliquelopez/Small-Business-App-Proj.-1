Short Documentation of What our program should be able to do: 


-	This program is intended for customers to have a virtual cashier to provide them options, and guide them through the ordering process. This is to make the ordering process more efficient, and to have little to no mistakes in their order(s). If the customer inputs their own wants (data), this eliminates the possibility of having more errors on the restaurants ordering system. On the business end of things, this program will create an efficient and more suitable way to ensure the customers needs are fully satisfied. It will mimic the “person to person” interaction with the customer to give a more personalized experience.  This program will display menu options such as meats, rice, beans, and toppings. Based on the users input data, the price will adjust accordingly as some menu options do cost more than others (i.e avocado, steak…). The program will store the input data in a text file and display a receipt to the customer with their name and order.
